heimdal (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Includes security fixes. Changes from upstream:

        * Fix security problem in rshd that enable an attacker to overwrite
          and change ownership of any file that root could write
          (CVE-2006-0582).

        * Fix a DOS in telnetd. The attacker could force the server to crash
          in a NULL de-reference before the user logged in, resulting in inetd
          turning telnetd off because it forked too fast (CVE-2006-0677).

        * Make gss_acquire_cred(GSS_C_ACCEPT) check that the requested name
          exists in the keytab before returning success. This allows servers
          to check if its even possible to use GSSAPI.

        * Fix receiving end of token delegation for GSS-API. It still wrongly
          uses subkey for sending for compatibility reasons, this will change
          in 0.8.

        * telnetd, login and rshd are now more verbose in logging failed and
          successful logins.

        * Bug fixes.

  * Ditch dbs build system in preference for quilt and cdbs.

  * Don't install /usr/include/ss. It's not included by any other header
    in heimdal-dev and is provided by ss-dev. Closes: #349213.

  * Also remove /usr/bin/mk_cmds which is also provided by ss-dev.

  * Supply /etc/ldap/schema/hdb.schema. Closes: #355287.

  * Move iprop man pages from heimdal-clients package into
    heimdal-kdc package. Closes: #347555.

  * Change default program for krsh from rlogin to ktelnet if no parameters
    given.  Closes: #355080.

  * minor changes to sample kdc.conf file. eg stash file created
  by postinst script wasn't used by kdc...

heimdal (0.2l-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * heimdal-kdc nows starts password server, so users can change
    passwords.
  * heimdal-kdc now inserts entry for kadmind into /etc/inetd.conf.
    kadmind is essential for normal kerberos administration.
  * Fix /etc/init.d/heimdal-kdc restart so it works.
  * No code has been changed/added/removed apart from postinst,
    prerm, postrm and init scripts for the above changes.
  * Got rid of stupid looking syntax for log file in sample kdc.conf.
  * Minor changes (including addition of examples) into README.Debian.
  * Known problem: debconf doesn't replace default value for
    some reason on initial installation. I can't see whats wrong...
    This is annoying, but not a critical problem.

heimdal (0.2j-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source.
  * Improved debconf support, using setconfig helper program.
  * setconfig may not parse all valid configuration files correctly.
    Patches welcome!
  * Moved /usr/bin/login to /usr/lib/heimdal-servers/login, as I
    suspect this will help porting to the Hurd, if/when anyone tries.
  * kdc now supports (and requires) logrotate.
  * kdc tested and now works with minimal configuration.
  * heimdal-kdc does not support dpkg-reconfigure (not sure how to
    reconfigure without deleting existing setup first).
